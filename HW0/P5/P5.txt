1. 255 seconds required to sum total 256 bags.
2. The process of counting would be faster. The time required to calculate the sum total of all the bags would be 34 seconds.
3. If the store has infinite number of employees, the problems becomes a binomial tree where each level takes 1 second to be solved. Hence the employeers can verify the sum in log(N) to the base 2 time where N is the next largest value in (2^n series. Hence the time required for 256 bags will be log(256) to base 2 which is 8 seconds.
4. Log2(N) time.
5. Considering the one second required to communicate between the levels, each level in the Binary tree takes 2 seconds to communicate the result to the next level except for the higest level where the sum is directly calculated and hence has no communication cost. The time required for 256 bags will be 2*Log2(N) - 1 which equals 15 seconds.
